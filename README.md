# Initium-Inventory
Tampermonkey script to inventory local items and local stores in the game Initium.

## Notes:  
Click "run inventory" to inventory everything on the ground wherever you are.
To inventory a store, click on the store.  It takes a long time.
Keep track of your progress in the Developer Java Console (in chrome at least)

You can export the data by clicking "export inventory" and it will export it
in JSON format.  I use it do display my gear using datatables.  Ask me about it.
